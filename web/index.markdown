## Description

The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including high-level programming abstractions, expressive
type systems and program analyses. We will develop these ideas in roughly
two parts. First, we will study various high-level programming abstractions
through the lens of [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), 
a *pure functional* programming language that has been the
incubator for many recent PL advances. In the second part we will
see how the lambda calculus can be used to distill essence 
of computation into a few powerful constructs, and we will use it 
as a launching pad to study expressive type systems, logics and 
analyses that can make precise predictions about run-time behavior
at compile time. For more details see the [lecture](lectures.html) plan.


## Prerequisites

The class is mostly self contained. However, it will be *helpful* to have
some knowledge of basic discrete math, and it will be *essential* 
that you enjoy programming and have a desire to learn the material.


##Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By 
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on 
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/manual/Appendices/app2.htm). 

In particular, *"all academic work will be done by the student to whom 
it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind."* You are expected 
to do your own work on all assignments; there are no group projects in 
this course.  You may (and are encouraged to) engage in **general** 
discussions with your classmates regarding the assignments, but specific 
details of a solution, including the solution itself, **must always be your own work**. 
There will be graded assignments and exam in this course, as described below. 
All exams are closed book; no implement other than your brain and a writing
instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to receiving a zero (0) on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties, 
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.
