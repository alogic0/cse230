- *Class Exercises (10%)* : 
  Will occur regularly, and may either be individual or group work. 
  They will typically be pencil-and-paper
  exercises that must be completed without the use of a computer.
  To do well, keep up with readings.  

- *Homework Assignments (60%)* : 
  About 5 mainly programming, done in pairs. 
  Will be assigned approximately every two weeks, 
  and instructions on turning them in will be posted with 
  each assignment. You have a total of *four late days* 
  that you can use throughout the quarter as you need them,
  where a late day means anything between 1 second and 23 
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline.

- *Final (30%)* : Take home, do alone.
