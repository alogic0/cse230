Problem 0: All About You
========================

Tell us your name, email and student ID, by replacing the respective
strings below

> myName  = "Write Your Name  Here"
> myEmail = "Write Your Email Here"
> mySID   = "Write Your SID   Here"

Problem 1: Binary Search Trees Revisited 
========================================

Recall the old type of binary search trees from
[HW2](/homeworks/Hw2.html).

> data BST k v = Emp 
>              | Bind k v (BST k v) (BST k v) 
>              deriving (Show)
> 
> toBinds ::  BST t t1 -> [(t, t1)]
> toBinds Emp            = []
> toBinds (Bind k v l r) = toBinds l ++ [(k,v)] ++ toBinds r

The following function tests whether a tree satisfies the 
binary-search-order invariant.

> isBSO ::  Ord a => BST a b -> Bool
> isBSO Emp            = True
> isBSO (Bind k v l r) = all (< k) lks && all (k <) rks && isBSO l && isBSO r
>   where lks = map fst $ toBinds l
>         rks = map fst $ toBinds r

Finally, to test your implementation, we will define a 
type of operations over trees

> data BSTop k v = BSTadd k v | BSTdel k 
>                  deriving (Eq, Show)

and a function that constructs a tree from a sequence of operations

> ofBSTops ::  Ord k => [BSTop k v] -> BST k v
> ofBSTops    = foldr doOp Emp
>   where doOp (BSTadd k v) = bstInsert k v 
>         doOp (BSTdel k)   = bstDelete k 

and that constructs a reference `Map` from a sequence of operations

> mapOfBSTops ::  Ord k => [BSTop k a] -> Map.Map k a
> mapOfBSTops = foldr doOp Map.empty 
>   where doOp (BSTadd k v) = Map.insert k v
>         doOp (BSTdel k)   = Map.delete k

and functions that generate an arbitrary BST operations

> keys :: [Int] 
> keys = [0..10]
>
> genBSTadd, genBSTdel, genBSTop ::  Gen (BSTop Int Char)
> genBSTadd = liftM2 BSTadd (elements keys) (elements ['a'..'z'])
> genBSTdel = liftM BSTdel (elements keys)
> genBSTop  = frequency [(5, genBSTadd), (1, genBSTdel)] 

(a) Insertion
-------------

Write an insertion function 

> bstInsert :: (Ord k) => k -> v -> BST k v -> BST k v
> bstInsert = error "TBD"

such that `bstInsert k v t` inserts a key `k` with value 
`v` into the tree `t`. If `k` already exists in the input
tree, then its value should be *replaced* with `v`. When you 
are done, your code should satisfy the following QC properties.

> prop_insert_bso :: Property
> prop_insert_bso = forAll (listOf genBSTadd) $ \ops -> 
>                     isBSO (ofBSTops ops)
>
> prop_insert_map = forAll (listOf genBSTadd) $ \ops -> 
>                     toBinds (ofBSTops ops) == Map.toAscList (mapOfBSTops ops)

(b) Deletion
------------

Write a deletion function for BSTs of this type:

> bstDelete :: (Ord k) => k -> BST k v -> BST k v
> bstDelete k t = error "TBD"

such that `bstDelete k t` removes the key `k` from the tree `t`. 
If `k` is absent from the input tree, then the tree is returned 
unchanged as the output. When you are done, your code should 
satisfy the following QC properties.

> prop_delete_bso :: Property
> prop_delete_bso = forAll (listOf genBSTop) $ \ops -> 
>                     isBSO (ofBSTops ops)
>
> prop_delete_map = forAll (listOf genBSTop) $ \ops -> 
>                     toBinds (ofBSTops ops) == Map.toAscList (mapOfBSTops ops)


(c) Balanced Trees  
------------------

The following function determines the `height` of a BST 

> height (Bind _ _ l r) = 1 + max (height l) (height r)
> height Emp            = 0

We say that a tree is *balanced* if 

> isBal (Bind _ _ l r) = isBal l && isBal r && abs (height l - height r) <= 2
> isBal Emp            = True

Write a balanced tree generator 

> genBal :: Gen (BST Int Char)
> genBal = error "TBD"

such that

> prop_genBal = forAll genBal isBal

(d) Height Balancing (** Hard **) 
---------------------------------

Rig it so that your insert and delete functions *also*
create balanced trees. That is, they satisfy the properties

> prop_insert_bal ::  Property
> prop_insert_bal = forAll (listOf genBSTadd) $ isBal . ofBSTops 
>
> prop_delete_bal ::  Property
> prop_delete_bal = forAll (listOf genBSTop) $ isBal . ofBSTops






Problem 2: Circuit Testing
==========================

Credit: [UPenn CIS552][1]

For this problem, you will look at a model of circuits in Haskell.

Signals
-------

A *signal* is a list of booleans.  

> newtype Signal = Sig [Bool]

By convention, all signals are infinite. We write a bunch of lifting
functions that lift boolean operators over signals.

> lift0 ::  Bool -> Signal
> lift0 a = Sig $ repeat a
> 
> lift1 ::  (Bool -> Bool) -> Signal -> Signal
> lift1 f (Sig s) = Sig $ map f s
> 
> lift2 ::  (Bool -> Bool -> Bool) -> (Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> lift2 f (Sig xs, Sig ys) = Sig $ zipWith f xs ys
> 
> lift22 :: (Bool -> Bool -> (Bool, Bool)) -> (Signal, Signal) -> (Signal,Signal)
> lift22 f (Sig xs, Sig ys) = 
>   let (zs1,zs2) = unzip (zipWith f xs ys)
>   in (Sig zs1, Sig zs2) 
> 
> lift3 :: (Bool->Bool->Bool->Bool) -> (Signal, Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> lift3 f (Sig xs, Sig ys, Sig zs) = Sig $ zipWith3 f xs ys zs
> 

Simulation
----------

Next, we have some helpers that can help us simulate a circuit by showing
how it behaves over time. For testing or printing, we truncate a signal to 
a short prefix 

> truncatedSignalSize = 20
> truncateSig bs = take truncatedSignalSize bs
> 
> instance Show Signal where
>   show (Sig s) = show (truncateSig s) ++ "..."
> 
> trace :: [(String, Signal)] -> Int -> IO ()
> trace desc count = do 
>   putStrLn   $ intercalate " " names
>   forM_ rows $ putStrLn . intercalate " " . rowS
>   where (names, wires) = unzip desc
>         rows           = take count . transpose . map (\ (Sig w) -> w) $ wires
>         rowS bs        = zipWith (\n b -> replicate (length n - 1) ' ' ++ (show (binary b))) names bs
> 
> probe :: [(String,Signal)] -> IO ()
> probe desc = trace desc 1
> 
> simulate :: [(String, Signal)] -> IO ()
> simulate desc = trace desc 20

Testing support (QuickCheck helpers)
------------------------------------

Next, we have a few functions that help to generate random tests

> instance Arbitrary Signal where
>   arbitrary = do 
>     x      <- arbitrary
>     Sig xs <- arbitrary
>     return $ Sig (x : xs)
> 
> arbitraryListOfSize n = forM [1..n] $ \_ -> arbitrary

To check whether two values are equivalent 

> class Agreeable a where
>   (===) :: a -> a -> Bool
> 
> instance Agreeable Signal where
>   (Sig as) === (Sig bs) = 
>     all (\x->x) (zipWith (==) (truncateSig as) (truncateSig bs))
> 
> instance (Agreeable a, Agreeable b) => Agreeable (a,b) where
>   (a1,b1) === (a2,b2) = (a1 === a2) && (b1 === b2)
> 
> instance Agreeable a => Agreeable [a] where
>   as === bs = all (\x->x) (zipWith (===) as bs)
> 

To convert values from boolean to higher-level integers

> class Binary a where
>   binary :: a -> Integer
> 
> instance Binary Bool where
>   binary b = if b then 1 else 0
> 
> instance Binary [Bool] where
>   binary = foldr (\x r -> (binary x) + 2 *r) 0

And to probe signals at specific points.

> sampleAt n (Sig b) = b !! n
> sampleAtN n signals = map (sampleAt n) signals
> sample1 = sampleAt 0
> sampleN = sampleAtN 0


Basic Gates
-----------

The basic gates from which we will fashion circuits can now be described.

> or2 ::  (Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> or2 = lift2 $ \x y -> x || y 
> 
> xor2 :: (Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> xor2 = lift2 $ \x y -> (x && not y) || (not x && y)
> 
> and2 :: (Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> and2 = lift2 $ \x y -> x && y 
> 
> imp2 ::  (Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> imp2 = lift2 $ \x y -> (not x) || y 
>
> mux :: (Signal, Signal, Signal) -> Signal
> mux = lift3 (\b1 b2 select -> if select then b1 else b2)
>
> demux :: (Signal, Signal) -> (Signal, Signal)
> demux args = lift22 (\i select -> if select then (i, False) else (False, i)) args
>
> muxN :: ([Signal], [Signal], Signal) -> [Signal]
> muxN (b1,b2,sel) = map (\ (bb1,bb2) -> mux (bb1,bb2,sel)) (zip b1 b2)
>
> demuxN :: ([Signal], Signal) -> ([Signal], [Signal])
> demuxN (b,sel) = unzip (map (\bb -> demux (bb,sel)) b)


Basic Signals 
-------------

Similarly, here are some basic signals

> high = lift0 True
> low  = lift0 False
>
> str   ::  String -> Signal
> str cs = Sig $ (map (== '1') cs) ++ (repeat False)
>
> delay ::  Bool -> Signal -> Signal
> delay init (Sig xs) = Sig $ init : xs


Combinational circuits
----------------------

**NOTE** When you are asked to implement a circuit, you must **ONLY** use
the above gates or smaller circuits built from the gates.

For example, the following is a *half-adder* (that adds a carry-bit to a
single bit).

> halfadd :: (Signal, Signal) -> (Signal, Signal)
> halfadd (x,y) = (sum,cout)
>   where sum   = xor2 (x, y)
>         cout  = and2 (x, y)

Here is a simple property about the half-adder

> prop_halfadd_commut b1 b2 =
>   halfadd (lift0 b1, lift0 b2) === halfadd (lift0 b2, lift0 b1) 

We can use the half-adder to build a full-adder

> fulladd (cin, x, y) = (sum, cout)
>   where (sum1, c1)  = halfadd (x,y)
>         (sum, c2)   = halfadd (cin, sum1)
>         cout        = xor2 (c1,c2) 
> 
> test1a = probe [("cin",cin), ("x",x), ("y",y), ("  sum",sum), ("cout",cout)]
>   where cin        = high
>         x          = low
>         y          = high
>         (sum,cout) = fulladd (cin, x, y)

and then an n-bit adder

> bitAdder :: (Signal, [Signal]) -> ([Signal], Signal)
> bitAdder (cin, [])   = ([], cin)
> bitAdder (cin, x:xs) = (sum:sums, cout)
>   where (sum, c)     = halfadd (cin,x)
>         (sums, cout) = bitAdder (c,xs)
> 
> test1 = probe [("cin",cin), ("in1",in1), ("in2",in2), ("in3",in3), ("in4",in4),
>                ("  s1",s1), ("s2",s2), ("s3",s3), ("s4",s4), ("c",c)]
>   where
>     cin = high
>     in1 = high
>     in2 = high
>     in3 = low
>     in4 = high
>     ([s1,s2,s3,s4], c) = bitAdder (cin, [in1,in2,in3,in4])

The correctness of the above circuit is described by the following property
that compares the behavior of the circuit to the *reference implementation*
which is an integer addition function

> prop_bitAdder_Correct ::  Signal -> [Bool] -> Bool
> prop_bitAdder_Correct cin xs =
>   binary (sampleN out ++ [sample1 cout]) == binary xs + binary (sample1 cin)
>   where (out, cout) = bitAdder (cin, map lift0 xs) 
 
Finally, we can use the bit-adder to build an adder that adds two N-bit numbers

> adder :: ([Signal], [Signal]) -> [Signal]
> adder (xs, ys) = 
>    let (sums,cout) = adderAux (low, xs, ys)
>    in sums ++ [cout]
>    where                                        
>      adderAux (cin, [], [])     = ([], cin)
>      adderAux (cin, x:xs, y:ys) = (sum:sums, cout)
>                                   where (sum, c) = fulladd (cin,x,y)
>                                         (sums,cout) = adderAux (c,xs,ys)
>      adderAux (cin, [], ys)     = adderAux (cin, [low], ys)
>      adderAux (cin, xs, [])     = adderAux (cin, xs, [low])
> 
> test2 = probe [ ("x1", x1), ("x2",x2), ("x3",x3), ("x4",x4),
>                 (" y1",y1), ("y2",y2), ("y3",y3), ("y4",y4), 
>                 (" s1",s1), ("s2",s2), ("s3",s3), ("s4",s4), (" c",c) ]
>   where xs@[x1,x2,x3,x4] = [high,high,low,low]
>         ys@[y1,y2,y3,y4] = [high,low,low,low]
>         [s1,s2,s3,s4,c]  = adder (xs, ys)

And we can specify the correctness of the adder circuit by

> prop_Adder_Correct ::  [Bool] -> [Bool] -> Bool
> prop_Adder_Correct l1 l2 = 
>   binary (sampleN sum) == binary l1 + binary l2
>   where sum = adder (map lift0 l1, map lift0 l2) 

Problem: Subtraction
--------------------

1. Using `prop_bitAdder_Correct` as a model, write a speciﬁcation for a
single-bit subtraction function that takes as inputs a N-bit binary 
number and a single bit to be subtracted from it and yields as
outputs an N-bit binary number. Subtracting one from zero should
yield zero.

> prop_bitSubtractor_Correct ::  Signal -> [Bool] -> Bool
> prop_bitSubtractor_Correct = error "TODO"

2. Using the `bitAdder` circuit as a model, deﬁne a `bitSubtractor` 
circuit that implements this functionality and use QC to check that 
your behaves correctly.

> bitSubtractor :: (Signal, [Signal]) -> ([Signal], Signal)
> bitSubtractor = error "TODO"


Problem: Multiplication
-----------------------

3. Using `prop_Adder_Correct` as a model, write down a QC speciﬁcation 
for a `multiplier` circuit that takes two binary numbers of arbitrary 
width as input and outputs their product.

> prop_Multiplier_Correct ::  [Bool] -> [Bool] -> Bool
> prop_Multiplier_Correct = error "TODO"

4. Deﬁne a `multiplier` circuit and check that it satisﬁes your 
speciﬁcation. (Looking at how adder is deﬁned will help with this, 
but you’ll need a little more wiring. To get an idea of how the 
recursive structure should work, think about how to multiply two 
binary numbers on paper.)

> multiplier :: ([Signal], [Signal]) -> [Signal]
> multiplier = error "TODO"
